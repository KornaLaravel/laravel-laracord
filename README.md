# Laracord

Laracord is a micro-framework that provides a powerful starting point for your next Discord bot.

Build functional, elegant bots harnessing the full power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) alongside [DiscordPHP](https://github.com/discord-php/DiscordPHP).

> [!WARNING]
> Laracord is currently [early in the development stage](https://github.com/laracord/framework/issues) and breaking changes are likely until a release is tagged.

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- [PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 8.1
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Getting Started

Start by creating a Laracord project:

```sh
composer create-project laracord/laracord:dev-main
cd laracord
```

In order to run the Bot, you will have to create a Application using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain a **bot token**.

By default, the Bot will also require you enable the necessary [Intents](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents). These can be found and enabled in the developer portal under `Settings > Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents`.

Once you obtain a token, you can configure it inside of `.env` or `config/discord.php`.

## Usage

Out of the box, Laracord includes a simple `!ping` command to test your bot with a simple response.

### Creating Commands

Creating your own command is simple and can be generated using the `laracord` binary:

```sh
php laracord make:command Example
```

A generated command in it's simplest form will look something like:

```php
namespace App\Commands;

use Laracord\Commands\Command;

class Example extends Command
{
    /**
     * The Discord command name.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $name = 'example';

    /**
     * The Discord command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'The command description.';

    /**
     * Execute the Discord command.
     *
     * @param  \Discord\Parts\Channel\Message  $message
     * @param  array  $args
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle($message, $args)
    {
        return $this
            ->message()
            ->title('Example')
            ->content('Hello world!')
            ->send($message);
    }
}
```

### Creating Services

Services are asynchronous tasks that run parallel to the Discord bot on an interval. This is useful for scenarios such as fetching data from an API every so often and sending the results to Discord through the bot.

Services created in your application are automatically booted alongside your bot with the Discord instance being easily accessible through `getDiscord()`.

To create a service, run the `make:service` command:

```php
php laracord make:service Example
```

The default generated service will create a task that logs `Hello World` to console every 5 seconds.

```php
namespace App\Services;

use Laracord\Services\Service;

class Example extends Service
{
    /**
     * The service interval.
     */
    protected int $interval = 5;

    /**
     * Handle the service.
     */
    public function handle(): void
    {
        $this->getConsole()->log('Hello world.');
    }
}
```

Sending a message to a Discord channel through a service can be done similarily to commands. The exception is you must get an instance of the channel/user to send the message to. This can be done through accessing the Discord instance:

```php
$channel = $this->getDiscord()->getChannel('your-channel-id');

$this
    ->message()
    ->content('Hello world')
    ->send($channel);
```

### Booting Laracord

To boot your bot, simply run `laracord` with no arguments passed:

```sh
php laracord
```

### Adding a Bot Admin

For convenience, Laracord comes with a console command to set a specified user as admin using their Discord ID:

```sh
php laracord bot:admin <id>
```

### Additional Commands

To view all built-in console commands, you can run the `list` command:

```sh
php laracord list
```

### Building for Production

To build your bot for production, simply run the `app:build` command:

```sh
php laracord app:build
```

Documentation for `app:build` can be found in the [Laravel Zero docs](https://laravel-zero.com/docs/build-a-standalone-application).

## Documentation

Laracord currently lacks it's own documentation, but you can find the documentation of the packages/frameworks it utilizes below to learn more in the mean time:

- [DiscordPHP](https://discord-php.github.io/DiscordPHP/)
- [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/docs)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs)

You may also be interested in the underlying [Laracord Framework](https://github.com/laracord/framework) source code to get a better understanding of existing functionality until proper documentation is written.
