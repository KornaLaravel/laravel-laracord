# Laracord

Laracord is a micro-framework that provides a powerful starting point for your next Discord bot.

Build functional, elegant bots harnessing the full power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) alongside [DiscordPHP](https://github.com/discord-php/DiscordPHP).

## Requirements

Make sure all dependencies have been installed before moving on:

- [PHP](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php) >= 8.1
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Getting Started

Start by creating a Laracord project:

```sh
composer create-project laracord/laracord
cd laracord
```

Once the project is created, you can proceed to run the default migration(s):

```sh
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

In order to run the Bot, you will have to create a Application using the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain a **bot token**.

By default, the Bot will also require you enable the necessary [Intents](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents). These can be found and enabled in the developer portal under `Settings > Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents`.

Once you obtain a token, you can configure it inside of `.env` or `config/discord.php`.

## Usage

Out of the box, Laracord includes a simple `!ping` command to test your bot with a simple response.

Creating your own command is simple and can be generated using the `laracord` binary:

```sh
php laracord make:command Example
```

To boot your bot, simply run `laracord` with no arguments passed:

```sh
php laracord
```

## Building for Production

To build your bot for production, simply run the `app:build` command:

```sh
php laracord app:build
```

Additional documentation on `app:build` can be found in the [Laravel Zero docs](https://laravel-zero.com/docs/build-a-standalone-application).
